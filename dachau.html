            <h2>That Was Dachau</h2>
            <p>I grew up overseas.  My dad was in the military, and we were stationed in England.  As a child, my family spent most of our Christmases in Germany.  My senior year of high school, my family revisited Germany for Christmas.  While my family lived overseas, I was too young to understand The Holocaust and the weight that came with this dark time in history.  That was Dachau, the name of a book written by historians detailing how such an atrocity happened, is also the name of this set.</p>

                <p>The entrance to Dachau Concentration Camp. The gate in the bottom of the building was the gate countless Jews, social outcasts, and political threats used to enter, but rarely exit.</p>

                <p>"May the example of those who were exterminated here between 1933 and 1945 because they resisted Naziism help to unite the living in the defense of peace and freedom and in respect for their fellow man." The phrase is written in eight different languages, and used to pay respects to those who died.</p>
