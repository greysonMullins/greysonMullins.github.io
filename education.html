        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I started my first semester at Georgia Tech in the fall of 2020.  In the age of COVID, it has been difficult to become at all involved in campus life.  When it becomes safe to return to a more normal campus life, I plan to become more involved.</p>
        <p>I attended Kennesaw State University through their Dual Enrollment Honors Program from August 2017 to my high school graduation in May 2019.  I was also part of their Undergraduate Honors Program until May 2020.  During my time at Kennsaw State, I maintained a 3.7 GPA.  I plan to maintain this level of academic excellence throughout my time at Georgia Tech.</p>
