        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a second year Computational Media student at Georgia Tech.  Until I was 15, I planned to major in mechanical engineering to become a literal rocket scientist.  However, I fell in love with video at the beginning of my freshman year in high school.  I credit my affinity to videography and photography to the opportunity it gives me to show people how I view the world.</p>
        <p>I am still learning what I truly want to spend the rest of my live doing, but I do know I want to use my skills to tell help tell stories of those silenced by society.  My biggest goal, and mantra in life is "be the person you needed when you were a kid".  It is for this reason that I plan to join the Peace Corps upon graduation from university.  Overall, I hope to leave this world a little better than it was before me.</p>
