                <p>I started working as a sports videographer in high school.  In March 2018, I started with SkillShow Sports Video Specialists, and worked events such as Perfect Game Baseball Showcases, Under Armour All American Football Camp, and Nike QB Showcases.  In August of 2020, I had the opportunity to work with the MLB Network at the Area Code Games in Emerson, GA.</p>
                <p>In June 2018, I began working as a student technican at Fifth Third Bank Stadium, home of all Kennesaw State Athletics and Atlanta United 2.  During this time I trained in Daktronics, Audio Engineering using the Midas M32R console, and ProPresenter sport.  I became the go to in house video switcher, and often worked with the Tricaster 850.  I have earned level one and level two Dante by Audinate certificates.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 2020, I began taking courses through the Georgia Film Academy.  I have completed GFA 1000, Introduction to Onset Production.  Through this course, I learned to identify basic grip gear, onset safety, and radio ettiquete.   I look forward to continuing to work on my certification when courses can be safely taught in person.</p>
